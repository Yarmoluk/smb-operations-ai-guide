# Glossary

## A

**ACLS (Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support)** — A certification for healthcare providers covering advanced interventions for cardiac arrest and other cardiovascular emergencies.

**AGI (Adjusted Gross Income)** — Total gross income minus specific deductions (retirement contributions, HSA, student loan interest). Determines eligibility for many tax benefits and phase-outs.

## B

**BLS (Basic Life Support)** — A foundational healthcare certification covering CPR, AED use, and basic airway management.

## C

**CapEx (Capital Expenditure)** — Spending on long-lived assets that are capitalized on the balance sheet and depreciated over time, rather than expensed immediately.

**Census** — In hospital staffing, the current count of patients occupying beds in a unit or facility. Drives staffing requirements in real-time.

**Constraint-Satisfaction Problem** — A mathematical problem where the goal is to find values for variables that satisfy a set of constraints simultaneously. Hospital staffing is a classic example.

## D

**DCFSA (Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account)** — A pre-tax account for dependent care expenses (daycare, after-school care). Maximum $5,000/household. Use-it-or-lose-it.

## N

**NP-Hard** — A class of computational problems for which no known algorithm can find the optimal solution in polynomial time. Hospital staffing with all constraints is NP-hard, meaning brute-force search of all possibilities is impractical.

**NRP (Neonatal Resuscitation Program)** — A certification for healthcare providers working with newborns, covering assessment and resuscitation techniques.
